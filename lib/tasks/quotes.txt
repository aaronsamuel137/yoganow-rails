Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.A:Buddha
We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves.A:Buddha
Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. An old day passes, a new day arrives. The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend - or a meaningful day.A:Dalai Lama
This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.A:Dalai Lama
We can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection.A:Dalai Lama
